Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a medication used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation.
Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.
Aspirin given shortly after a heart attack decreases the risk of death.
Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk.
It may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.
